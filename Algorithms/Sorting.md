## Bubble sort
- A na√Øve approach to sorting any comparable values in a list.
Python code snippet:
```python
def bubblesort(arr):
	for i in range(len(arr)) #For each element of array
		for j in range(len(arr)-1) #Go through entire array
			if arr[j] < arr[j+1]: # Find maximal element and swap
				temp = arr[j]
				arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
				arr[j + 1] = temp
```
Pseudocode:
```
For j in :
	Loop through entire list:
		Find maximal element and move to the 
```
